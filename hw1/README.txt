This is my submission of hw1-- eigendigit.
In this folder:
hw1report.pdf : The report that illustrate how the algo and the result of my algo.
eigenVectorpicture: A directory including more pictures of the eigenvectors
testpicturebefore: A directory including more testing pictures to display what they looks like when loaded in.
All pictures are named like before1.png, with only difference in the numerical value. The one digit numerical value reflects what digit does this picture reflects.

testpictureafter: A directory including more testing pictures to display what they looks like after transformation. All pictures are named like after1.png, with only difference in the numerical value. The one digit numerical value reflects what digit does this picture reflects.
code.zip: A zip file including the source file and the test data
In code.zip:
	hw1.py: The source code. To run it, simply type python "hw1.py" in the command line. It will display the accuracy of the prediction on terminal when finished running.
	The code also including the part that print out eigenvectors, testing data before and after the transformation. 
	This segment of code is commented out right now for fostering the performance. You can un-comment it to run so that 
	gives you the pictures you would like to inspect.
	digits.mat: all data we used.

README.txt: This file. An introduction and overview of all files.
